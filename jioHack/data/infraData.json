Wiggle the power cord where it plugs into the back of the printer to make sure it is not loose. Some models of desk jets have a two part power cord. In this case, check along the length of the power cord to make sure both parts are plugged in together.\nIf the printer is still not getting power, plug the power cord into a different outlet on the power strip. If this does not work, try plugging the printer into a different wall outlet.\nCheck to see if you can print a Windows test page\nThe windows test page is a basic communication test between your computer and the printer. To print a Windows test page:\nLeft mouse-click on the Start button.\nGo to Settings and then select Printers.

If the document does not print from that program, the printing problem has to do with that program.\nCheck to see if there is paper in printer. Is their a paper jam?\nIf the printer has paper in the paper tray, the paper may be jammed or not feeding properly. Take the paper out of the paper tray and check to see that the top piece of paper is not crinkled or bent.\nIf the printer is a DeskJet, lift open the front cover and look to see if a piece of paper is halfway fed through. If it is, remove paper gently from the top and close.\nIf the printer is a LaserJet, open the top of the printer and check for paper underneath the toner cartridge. If there is paper there, gently remove it, and replace the toner cartridge.\nCheck to see if the computer getting a signal from the printer.\nThe computer and the printer must be communicating before the printer will print. When you send a document to print, does a small printer appear on the Windows taskbar (down by the time)? If this printer appears on the taskbar, the computer thinks the printer is receiving communication. At this point, the printer should blink lights (if a DeskJet) or says \"printing\" or \"receiving\" on the display (if a laser printer). If the printer is not receiving the communication from the computer, try restarting the computer.

This just tests to see if the ink cartridge is defective.\nIf the printer is a LaserJet, try changing the toner cartridge. If the new toner cartridge does not improve the streaking problem, return old cartridge to the printer and place the new toner cartridge back in its original packaging for later use.\nIf neither option works, please visit the printer maintenance vendor list to schedule printer service.\nThe printer in spite of everything is not printing?\nTurn the PC off.
